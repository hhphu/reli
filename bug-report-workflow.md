# Bug Report Workflow

When encountering a bug, these are the steps that I would follow for submitting and managing it:

1. Review the documents that provide the business logics/requirements for the feature
  - I need to make sure that all the requirements are correct and up-to-date, and I understand the requirements of the features, before proceeding further. 
  - Also, I need to double check with my Project Manager to see if there’s any undocumented changes of the feature that I am not aware of.
    
2. Steps for verifying and reproducing bugs.
  - Check to see if everything is set up correctly for the feature. Based on the documents, I can determine prerequisites for a feature to run. I make sure those prerequisites are met.
  - Try to reproduce the issue. I make sure to clear caches, test the issue on multiple platforms (desktop, mobile, tablets, iOS, Android, etc.). This step can also help me determine the reproducibility of the issue.
  - Determine all the values listed in the Bug Report templates: Severity, steps to reproduce, screenshots, code snippets, etc.
  - Also, determine if the current affects any other functionalities of the applications. This is important to determine the severity and the urgency of the issue.

3. Ensure timely assignment and follow-up
  - Make sure that the issue is addressed in the planning meetings. 
  - Update or create new test cases for the issue. Make sure that the same issue won’t occur in the future after the fix.
  - Update requirements in documents.
  - Have the developer who works on the issue review the test cases to ensure there is no misunderstanding when it comes to requirements/logics of the feature.
  - Once the fix is delivered, I verify the fix on all the platforms. I also make sure the fix does not affect other functionalities.
  - Once the fix is pushed to production, verify that the issue no longer occurs. I also continued to monitor it on production to make sure everything is good.
