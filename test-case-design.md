# Test Case for Bid Optimization Feature

| **Test Case ID** | **Description** | **Inputs** | **Expected Outputs** | **Notes** |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ---------- | -------------------- | --------- |
| TC001 | Validate aggregation of performance metrics by keyword group | Data with multiple targets having the same `Group ID`, `Keyword Text`, `Match Type`, and `Campaign Type`. | Aggregated performance metrics (e.g., clicks, impressions, CTR) calculated correctly for each keyword group. | Ensure data includes targets with overlapping and unique group IDs. |
| TC002 | Validate bid calculation using the "average bid" method | Keyword group with multiple targets and their associated bids. | Effective bid calculated as the average of all target bids within the group. | Test with varied bid amounts (e.g., $1.50, $2.00, $3.00).  |
| TC003 | Validate bid calculation using the "highest-performing target" | Keyword group with performance metrics for each target (e.g., clicks, conversions). | Effective bid set to the bid of the highest-performing target within the group. | Define "highest-performing" based on clear metrics (e.g., highest CTR or conversion rate). |
| TC004 | Validate bid calculation for paused targets | Group with both active and paused targets, where paused targets include performance data. | Paused targets are included in the bid calculation if within the specified time window; otherwise, excluded. | Assume paused targets with no recent performance are excluded.                                          |
| TC005 | Validate time-based rule application for Weekday_day version   | Performance data for Monday-Friday between 4 AM and 7 PM. | Bid optimizations applied only during the specified time window (Weekday_day). | Ensure performance data outside this window is ignored. |
| TC006 | Validate time-based rule application for Weekend_night version | Performance data for Saturday-Sunday between 7 PM and 4 AM. | Bid optimizations applied only during the specified time window (Weekend_night). | Include data spanning transitions between time windows. |
| TC007 | Validate exclusion of groups with insufficient data | Keyword groups with fewer than 5 clicks in their aggregated performance metrics. | No bid optimizations are applied to groups with fewer than 5 clicks. | Include groups with exactly 4 and 5 clicks for boundary testing. |
| TC008 | Validate handling of missing performance metrics | Keyword group with missing values for required metrics (e.g., clicks, impressions). | Bid optimizations skipped for groups with missing performance data. | Ensure clear error messages or logs are generated for missing data. |
| TC009 | Validate handling of invalid bid values | Targets with bid values that are negative, zero, or non-numeric. | Invalid bid values are flagged, and optimizations skip such targets while aggregating the rest. | Include error handling mechanisms in the test. |
| TC010 | Validate database updates for bid changes | Simulated bid updates for multiple keyword groups. | Bid changes are saved correctly in the database, and the `keyword_multivers` table is updated accurately. | Verify logs or database change history for accuracy. |
| TC011 | Validate outlier handling in bid calculations | Keyword group with an outlier bid significantly higher or lower than the rest. | Outliers are excluded or appropriately weighted in bid calculations, based on the defined rules. | Test with a range of thresholds for defining outliers. |
